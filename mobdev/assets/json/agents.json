Although she's the chief of Section 6, Miyabi does little work related to it, with bureaucratic tasks being handled by Deputy Chief Tsukishiro Yanagi.\n\nMiyabi has a great obsession with training, finding numerous ways to classify mundane tasks as a form of training, such as opening surprise boxes, watching films, and not attending meetings. The intensity of some of her training leads her to black out and enter a trance-like state, where's she's only capable of parroting the last word said by another.",

These included giving young Miyabi unique trainings like eating all her vegetables, sleeping eight hours, and remembering all their family memberâ€™s names, while also her horseback riding, archery, calligraphy, and how to play an instrument.\n\nHowever, Hollow Zero's sudden expansion destroyed the Hoshimi family home and corrupted many of its members, including Miyabi's mother. Severely corrupted, she handed Miyabi Tailless and described her the last training: to use their family blade to end her life before she could mutate into an Ethereal. After mercifully killing her mother, under the influence of the katana's power, Miyabi entered a frenzy state and slayed countless Ethereals, event which would later be addressed by her father as an 'accident.'\n\nYears later, Miyabi would hold Tailless once more, with the desire of protecting the citizens of New Eridu by becoming an officer. Her father supported her daughter's plan by crafting an advanced scabbard able to seal the cursed katana's power.\n\nDuring her time at the Public Security Training Academy, Miyabi befriended fellow classmate Zhu Yuan and almost lost her family's katana to a scam by Nicole Demara, but was soon given it back by the streetwise woman. After graduating, Miyabi enlisted in H.A.N.D. and quickly became an executive officer.\n\nHoshimi Miyabi was crucial in the successful containment of the Argos Hollow by managing to destroy the massive ethereal Lerna in under three minutes, saving the life of around 208 people. This feat rewarded Miyabi with the esteemed title of Void Hunter, but instead of attending the ceremony, she took advantage of her new position to transfer fellow executive officer Asaba Harumasa and Defense Force member Tsukishiro Yanagi to the newly founded Hollow Special Operations Section 6, which she created to uncover and destroy the roots of corruption within New Eridu and find the true culprits behind the Fall of the Old Capital, in order to avenge her late mother."

This plan never came to fruition, however, as Caesar King from the Sons of Calydon would end up defeating the faux kidnappers and 'saving' her in the process.

         "backstory": "Before the Fall of the Old Capital, Anby used to be known as Soldier 0, the captain of the Silver Squad, a group within the New Eridu Defense Force Obsidian Division. Unlike other squads, Silver Squad's infantry consisted of replicas, artificial humans made via genetic cloning. This made them incredibly loyal and powerful (albeit high-maintenance) soldiers that could be easily replaced if they died in battle. She was considered the best of all the replicas, obedient to the point she would kill herself if ordered.\n\nAll replicas considered themselves to be sisters and cared for each other as family. Therefore, when the Defense Force tried to select only one replica to keep to get rid of the others and cut the maintenance costs, Anby failed her tests on purpose to convince the Obsidian Division the entire Silver Squad was needed and not get rid of her sisters. However, it could not go on forever: one day, their superiors decided to devise a suicide mission to kill off all members of the Silver Squad and keep Anby as the sole replica. However, the night before the operation, Harin, also known as Soldier 11, got injured during training, so Anby took her place for deployment.\n\nDespite the mission being created ad hoc to leave no soldier alive, Anby managed to survive and return to the base after witnessing the death of her sisters. Upon her return, her disgruntled superiors, who wanted to keep only one replica alive, gave Anby the order to kill Soldier 11. In an act of disobedience towards her superiors and of love towards her sister, Anby slit her own throat instead, so that the Obsidian Division would be forced to keep Soldier 11 as the sole replica. Her superiors hence kept Soldier 11 and disposed of Anby's body by leaving it by the ruins of the Old Capital, where she was found by Nicole Demara, who took her in as the first member of Gentle House and gave her her own surname.\n\nWhen a replica sustains a heavy injury, their memory gets damaged, leading to temporary retrograde amnesia. Therefore, it took a while before Anby remembered her past as Soldier 0. When the memories of her time in the Silver Squad came back, she asked Nicole to gather information regarding Soldier 11; as she learnt that her sister had joined Obol Squad and became an exemplary soldier, Anby decided it was best to leave her be, feeling that their shared past would only weigh greatly on her."

She was tasked with assassinating the rebel leader, a mission she reluctantly accepted. Whilst making her way to the leader's hideout, she met a young Soukaku and soon saved her from an oncoming missile strike, being captured by Oni rebels in the process. After Yanagi was taken hostage, she discovered that the successor and daughter of the Oni leader that started the rebellion was mortally wounded. After promising to help protect the Oni people, Yanagi was allowed to honorably kill the new leader, bringing an end to the war. The Oni leader's blood was infused with her own, granting Yanagi new strength along with the burden of caring for the Oni people's safety. Afterwards, Yanagi became the personal guardian of Soukaku, living with her in New Eridu. As a member of the Defense Force. she collaborated with H.A.N.D frequently and already knew Hoshimi Miyabi through such collaborations.\n\nYanagi was present during the Argos Hollow incident, where she calculated the amount of casualties if the Shiyu Pillar was detonated and stated she would perform the task if Miyabi failed to defeat Lerna in three minutes. After Miyabi's victory, she, alongside H.A.N.D executive officer Asaba Harumasa, were transferred to the newly formed Hollow Special Operations Section 6 by the newly titled Void Hunter in order to expose the roots of corruption within New Eridu Yanagi later ascended to Deputy Chief, taking responsibility for both her ward and her fellow members. \n\nDuring an invitation by the Hollow Investigative Association to test out their VR system, Yanagi became crucial in saving her teammates' lives when the systems were hacked by the Proxy group Null_Face, trapping them within the virtual environment.
