This plan never came to fruition, however, as Caesar King from the Sons of Calydon would end up defeating the faux kidnappers and 'saving' her in the process. From that point on, Lucy vowed to become a fully fledged member of the Sons of Calydon herself."

Its leader, Miguel Silver, took on a fatherly role in her life. Nonetheless, due to differing beliefs from the gang, she opted to part ways and go it alone.\nFollowing certain encounters involving Nicole and others, she eventually opted to enlist in Gentle House, thus becoming the third member of the team."
