Although she's the chief of Section 6, Miyabi does little work related to it, with bureaucratic tasks being handled by Deputy Chief Tsukishiro Yanagi Miyabi has a great obsession with training, finding numerous ways to classify mundane tasks as a form of training, such as opening surprise boxes,watching films,and not attending meetings.The intensity of some of her training leads her to black out and enter a trance-like state, where's she's only capable of parroting the last word said by another."
